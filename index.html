      Who is it for: <br />
      Skyrim, and The Elder Scrolls series in general, is a great game for
      people who have an interest in trying a digital format of pen-and-paper
      role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. If you enjoy having control
      of things like fantasy races such as elves, orcs, humanoids, and
      anthropomorphic animals, and being put into a world where your actions can
      give different outcomes, you may find an interest in this game. Skyrim is
      also filled with lore and information about the fictional world, bringing
      video creators and bloggers looking to figure out widespread mysteries and
      information to new gamers or people with an interest in the game.
